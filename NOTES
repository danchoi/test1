Web app framework experiments

1. dynamically read the database (psql) schema and generate routes and
formbuilders.

2. JSON endpoints and processors are dynamically created

  One processor is the form representer

3. Form builder function automatically from the schema.




notes

  digestive functors. 
    forms composable
    more time consuming at first, less later



YAML for a resource/form pair:

users: 
- - login
  - email

Concept of HTML representation snippets of areas of view. Like most
popular, etc. These are not typical Rails model methods that are then
passed onto controller and then templated. Make each chunk of the view a 
unit that can be output as json, yaml, or the final HTML (of numerous
types). The chunk is really a function (inspired by Haskell) that can
take args and then use them to tailor results to a specific user, etc.


Table-centric. Make tables in db and then output as dt,dl,table,forms,
etc. Many reusable components
